# Product Pagination Demo

A simple React application demonstrating pagination functionality with the following features:

1. **Product Display**: Shows products in a responsive grid layout with images and titles, fetched from an external API.

2. **Page Navigation**: Includes Previous/Next buttons and clickable page numbers for easy navigation through product pages.

3. **Dynamic Pagination**: Automatically calculates total pages based on product count, with 18 items displayed per page.

4. **Visual Feedback**: Current page is highlighted, and navigation buttons are disabled when reaching first/last pages.
